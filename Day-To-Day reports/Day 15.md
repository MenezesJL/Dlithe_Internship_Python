# Day 15:

## Functions:

* A **function** is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
* **Functions** provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

Example:

```python
# Defining the function
def bar():
    print("Hallo")
    print("Wie geht's")
    
# Calling the function
bar()
```
