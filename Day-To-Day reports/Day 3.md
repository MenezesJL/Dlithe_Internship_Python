# Day 3

## Number datatypes

1. Int

2. Float

3. Complex

   ```python
   # a+bj
   a = 10 +5j # a is real, b is imaginary, j**2 = -1 .
   a.real	gives 10 in return.
   a.img gives 5 in return.
   ```

## String

- Collection of sequence of charector
- It is enclosed with `""` or `''`
- `\"` and `\'` used with
- `'''comment'''`triple quote is used for multiline comments
- It supports reverse index like -1
- Index starts with 0.
- Supports slicing [:]
  - syntax `[<startindex>:<endindex>:<stepindex>]`
- Default step index is 1.
- Supports repetition `*` like `print("foo"*200)`
- `+` is used for string concatenation.

## List

- Its Mutable means we can modify items in list.
- Collection of dissimilar data items enclosed with in `[]`
- It maintains Insertion order.
- It supports indexing, slicing, repetition, concatenation.
- performance is slow and bitwise lager than tuple.

## Tuple

- Its Immutable means cannot delete items in tuple.
- Collection is dissimilar data items enclosed in `()`.
- performance is higher than list and smaller in bitwise.

Functions

- input()
  - syntax
- print()
  - syntax



Example program:

```python
#Program to calculate compound interest
#Getting input from user:
principal = int(input("princial amount :"))
rate = float(input("Interest rate :"))
years = float(input("Number of years :"))

interest = principal*(1+rate/100)**years #calculating interest

print("Compound Interest :",round(interest,2)) #Prints only 2 digits after the decimal point.
```


```python
#Program to print Simple Interest
principal = int(input("princial amount :"))
rate = int(input("Interest rate :"))
years = float(input("Number of years :"))

interest = (principal*years*rate)/100

print("Compound Interest :",round(interest,2))

```
